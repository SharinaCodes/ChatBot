# Chatbot Project

## Overview
This project involves the development of a simple Java-based chatbot. The bot is designed to interact with users through a series of stages, gradually increasing its capabilities from basic greetings to conducting a simple quiz.

## Features
- **Greeting**: Introduces itself with a predefined name and creation year.
- **Name Recognition**: Asks for the user's name and acknowledges it in the conversation.
- **Age Guessing**: Utilizes a mathematical formula to guess the user's age based on remainders obtained from the user.
- **Counting Ability**: Demonstrates its ability to count up to any number provided by the user.
- **Programming Quiz**: Conducts a simple multiple-choice quiz to test the user's programming knowledge.

## Stages of Development
1. **Stage 1 - Basic Greeting**: The bot introduces itself with a name and the year it was created.
2. **Stage 2 - Name Interaction**: The bot asks for and remembers the user's name.
3. **Stage 3 - Age Guessing**: Implements a feature to guess the user's age using a special arithmetic formula.
4. **Stage 4 - Counting Skill**: Adds the ability for the bot to count to a number provided by the user.
5. **Stage 5 - Simple Quiz**: Introduces a programming-related quiz where the bot continues to ask a question until the correct answer is provided.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Scanner class for input handling

## How to Run
1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Compile the `Main.java` file: `javac Main.java`
3. Run the compiled program: `java Main`

## Sample Interaction
```
Hello! My name is Jeffrey.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
> [User enters name]
What a great name you have, [Name]!
Let me guess your age.
Enter the remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5, and 7.
> [User enters remainders]
Your age is [Calculated Age]; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> [User enters a number]
[Bot counts up to the number]
Let's test your programming knowledge.
[Bot asks a programming question]
> [User answers question]
[Bot responds appropriately]
```
